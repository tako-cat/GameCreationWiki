# Game Engine Wiki
A game engine is a software framework that
creates a space for developers to build a
video game and generally includes built-in
libraries. Some reusable development tools include AI
functions, 2D or 3D graphics, a physics engine/collision
detection, sound, scripting, animation, networking,
streaming, memory management, threading, localization
support, scene graph, and video support for cinematics.
Most game engines have their own languages, for example, Unity uses C# and Unreal Engine uses C++.

# Purpose
The purpose of a game engine is to create a good space to
easily make video games and quickly release them. In game
development, the easier it is to learn the language, create
the game, and release it, the better the engine.
